Introducing Docker Compose to run 
https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/
On this page you build a simple Python web application running on Docker Compose. 
The application uses the Flask framework and maintains a hit counter in Redis. 
While the sample uses Python, the concepts demonstrated here should be understandable 
even if youâ€™re not familiar with it.

Check web site with http://localhost:5000/
Refresh the page and see how the hit counter increments.
